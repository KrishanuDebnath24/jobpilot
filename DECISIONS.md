# DECISIONS

Running log of non-obvious engineering choices. One line + rationale each.

## Phase 0 — Scaffold

- **Monorepo layout `/backend /frontend /mcp /orchestrator`.** Matches the target
  architecture; `mcp/` and `orchestrator/` are placeholders until Phase 1+ so the
  tree is stable from day one.
- **Backend deps via `requirements.txt` (not Poetry/uv).** Fewer moving parts for a
  Dockerized FastAPI service; easy to pin. Revisit if the team wants a lockfile tool.
- **Auth password hashing with the `bcrypt` library directly (not `passlib`).**
  `passlib`'s bcrypt backend is unmaintained and warns against modern `bcrypt` 4.x.
  Calling `bcrypt` directly is simpler and avoids the version-detection breakage.
- **JWT via `PyJWT` + OAuth2 password flow.** Standard, dependency-light, and plays
  cleanly with FastAPI's `OAuth2PasswordBearer`.
- **Phase 0 test user is in-memory (seeded from `TEST_USER_EMAIL/PASSWORD`).** The
  `users` table + real persistence arrive in Phase 1; keeping auth working end-to-end
  now without a DB lets the health-check slice stay small and verifiable.
- **`/health` is a pure liveness check (no DB dependency).** Phase 0's gate is
  "health passing across both services"; DB/Redis readiness probes land in Phase 1
  once migrations exist. Compose still starts Postgres+pgvector and Redis so the
  environment is ready.
- **Tailwind v3.4 (not v4).** v3 config is stable and well-documented; avoids v4's
  in-flux config story for a scaffold. shadcn/ui is deferred to the first real UI
  phase (Phase 3 dashboard).
- **Frontend calls the API from the browser via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.** Simplest
  wiring for the health check; a server-side proxy/BFF can come later if needed.
- **Postgres image `pgvector/pgvector:pg16`.** Ships Postgres 16 with the `pgvector`
  extension preinstalled, exactly what the data model (embeddings) needs in Phase 1.
- **Next.js pinned to `14.2.35` (latest patched 14.2.x); framework-major bump deferred
  to Phase 8.** 14.2.35 clears the Dec-2025 critical advisory. Two residual transitive
  advisories remain, both accepted for now: (1) `next` "high" DoS via the Image
  Optimizer `remotePatterns` — **not applicable**, we use no `next/image`/remote
  patterns; (2) `postcss` "moderate" XSS in CSS stringify — **build-time only**, never
  shipped to the client runtime. npm's only offered fix is Next 16 (breaking major,
  pulls React 19), which is out of scope for a scaffold and slots naturally into the
  Phase 8 hardening pass.
